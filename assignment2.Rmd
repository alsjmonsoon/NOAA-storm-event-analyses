### The most harmful storm events for health and economy in the U.S
date: "October 14, 2015"

================================================================================

## Synopsis

I cleaned and analyzed the NOAA storm data from 1950-2011 in this exercise and there are two main research goals: 1) Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2) which types of events have the greatest economic consequences? My work show that out of the 48 storm event types (permitted by NOAA database), the most harmful events for health are tornado, excessive heat, flood, thunderstorm wind and lightening. The most harmful events for economy are: Hurriance(aka Typhoon), storm surge, Flood, and Tornado. Therefore, policy makers who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events need to take these data into consideration and prioritize resources for different types of events.

## Data Processing
setwd("set your working directory here")

```{r loadingPackages, warning=F, message=FALSE,cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# load relavant R packages for this work
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(R.utils)
library(readr)
library(reshape2) 
```

``` {r download data, warning=F, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# download and unzip data, then read data

# Unzipping the file externally (becasue the file is a bit large) to save memory

if(!file.exists("stormDT.csv")){
     library(R.utils) 
     dlMethod <- "curl"
     if(substr(Sys.getenv("OS"),1,7) == "Windows") dlMethod <- "wininet"
     url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
     download.file(url,destfile='stormDT.csv.bz2',method=dlMethod,mode="wb")
     bunzip2("stormDT.csv.bz2",
          "stormDT.csv")
}

#the readr::read_csv is mangintude faster than read.csv in the base R. NOTE: because this analyses focuses on storm events impact oon health and economy, I have only kept relavant columns from the data for the orginal data. Other columns are discarded by set col_types with a compact string as below:

stormDT1 <- read_csv("stormDT.csv",
     n_max = 902297,         # use n_max if N is known, to allocate memory efficiently
     col_types ="ic__iccc______________iidcdc_______ci") #designates columns to skip

# note you can read the csv.bz2 directly (as following), but it uses up a lot of memories. Becaes bz2 only have one file in it, therefore it is possible use read.csv() to read it directly.

# fileUrl<-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
# download.file(fileUrl,destfile="stormDT.csv.bz2",method="curl")
# stromDT1<-read.csv("stromDT.csv")
```

###Strategy of mapping EVTYPE with multiple evnet types for health related data

#### I only selected that the events which greater than 0 fatalities or injuries because this assignment asks for the comparing the which event(s) cause the most injuries and falaty. 
```{r cleaningHealthData, warning=F, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE }

stormDT1$BGN_DATE<-as.Date(stormDT1$BGN_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y 0:00:00")

# add a year column
stormDT1$YEAR <- as.POSIXlt(stormDT1$BGN_DATE)$year + 1900

# I used all data from 1996-2011 becasue: 1) From 1950 through 1954, only tornado events were recorded; 2) From 1955 through 1992, only tornado, thunderstorm wind and hail events were keyed from the paper publications into digital data; 3) From 1996 to present, 48 event types are recorded as defined in NWS Directive 10-1605. Therefore there is no true comparable data for all 48 types of events for the years 1950 through 1995.

stormDT2<-stormDT1[stormDT1$YEAR>=1996,]

# remove observations there are no fatatlities and injuries
healthDT1<-stormDT2%>%
        filter(FATALITIES!=0|INJURIES!=0)%>%
        select(-(PROPDMG:CROPDMGEXP))

## Results

#### 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

```{r Plot1, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE}

# For this report and figure, I only consider events which have at least caused one fatality or one injury per year. In another word, total of 15 health-related damage for the period of 1996-2011 (total of 15 years) are plotted in the figure. 

topHealthDT<-healthsummaryDT%>%
        filter((totalFatality+totalInjury)>15)

# change the data into a long format
             
healthLong<-melt(topHealthDT)

ggplot(healthLong,aes(x=EVTYPE,y=value/1000,fill=variable))+
        geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity")+
        coord_flip()+
        labs(x="", y="Total of numbers of Fatality and Injury (thousand)")+
        ggtitle("Fig.1 The most harmful storm events across the U.S.")+
        theme_bw()+
        theme(panel.grid.major=element_blank(),panel.grid.minor=element_blank())+

              axis.text.x=element_text(size=12),
              legend.position=c(.75,.1)) #tweak the numbers for the positon

```
**Conclusion: It is clear that the top five  most harmful storm event that cause the most health-related damage are tornado, excessive heat, flood, thunderstorm wind and lightening. Because I did not normalize the injury and fatality to the same economical scale, and it is hard to tell which one has more economical impact (such as medical cost, insurance, funeral cost etc). Therefore this figure is documented for total numbers of fatality and injury, not economical impact of these accidents.**

#### 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

```{r Plot2, fig.width=9,fig.height=6,fig.align='center',warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE,echo=TRUE}

# change the order of factor levels by specifying the order explicitly based on property damage

ecosummary$EVTYPE<-factor(ecosummary$EVTYPE,
                          level=ecosummary$EVTYPE[order(ecosummary$totalPROPDMGUSD)])

# For this report, I only consider events which have at least caused the total of 5 million USD damages (that is, the sum of property and crop damage must exceed 5 million USD ) during the period of 1996-2011 (total of 15 years). 

topEcoDT<-ecosummary%>%
        filter((totalPROPDMGUSD+totalCROPDMGUSD)>5*1e+6)

# change to the long format 

ecoLong<-melt(topEcoDT)

levels(ecoLong$variable)[levels(ecoLong$variable)=="totalPROPDMGUSD"]<-"property"
levels(ecoLong$variable)[levels(ecoLong$variable)=="totalCROPDMGUSD"]<-"crops"

ggplot(ecoLong,aes(x=EVTYPE,y=value/1e+9,fill=variable))+
        geom_bar(position="dodge",stat="identity")+
        coord_flip()+
        labs(x="", y="Total damage of property and crops (billion USD)")+
        ggtitle("Fig.2 The most damaging storm events across the U.S.for economy")+
        theme_bw()+theme(panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
                         panel.grid.minor=element_blank())+
        theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=11),
              axis.text.x=element_text(size=12),
              legend.position=c(.9,.1))+
        theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1),face="bold"))
```

**Conclusion: From my data analysis, it is clear that the top five most harmful storm events for US.economy are: hurriance (typhoon),storm surge, flood, tornado,heavy snow. It is also clear that drought caused the most crop damage during 1996-2011. Please note, I did not count for the economical infliation during 1996-2011 when considering the property and crop damage, therefore this report may not realistically present the real economic damage.**
